# Experiment-15
## Program 1
### Aim: 
Find the factorial of a number using recursion
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
Programming recursion is the process by which a function calls itself to resolve smaller instances of the same issue. The function repeatedly calls itself by reducing the number until it reaches the base case in order to use recursion to find the factorial of a given number.
The product of all integers from 1 to n is the factorial of a number n (represented as n!). The calculation is broken down as follows by the recursive process: n! = n * (n-1)!
Since the factorial of 0 or 1 is equal to 1, the base case happens when n is either 0 or 1. When this base case is reached, the recursion ends, and the outcomes are passed back up the recursive calls.

### Conclusion:
We found the factorial of a number using recursion in C++. 

## Program 2
### Aim: 
Find the Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
Beginning with 0 and 1, the Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers where each one is equal to the sum of the two numbers before it. Calling the function to calculate the previous two Fibonacci numbers and adding them together is the recursive method for determining the Fibonacci number at a specific location.

### Conclusion:
We found the fibonacci series for n number using recursion in C++.

## Program 3
### Aim: 
Find sum of n natural numbers using recursion, n is the value entered by user.
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
The problem is divided into smaller subproblems in order to use recursion to determine the sum of the first n natural numbers. The first n numbers added together are: n + Sum(n-1) = Sum(n)
Since the sum of the first natural number (1) is just 1, the base case happens when n reaches 1. The recursive function reduces the problem size until it reaches the base case, at which point it stops and returns the result. It does this by adding the current number n to the result of Sum(n-1).

### Conclusion:
We learned how to add n numbers using recursion in C++.
